clone the repo at https://github.com/onecoderave/flatironapptest.git

cd into flatironapptest and then run 'npm install'.

once done run 'npm run dev'. this will start the react app and a json-server running on 3000 and 5000 respectively.

then click on the profile pics that you see on the screen.

for a split second you will see the message logging the profile view....., for the duration the view log is being persisted to the json-server db.json file.

db.json is located inside of the root directory, where you can find the view log of profile clicks under the views key.
